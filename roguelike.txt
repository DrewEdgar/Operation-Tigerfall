Rogue like maze game

2d with 3d perspective
Turnbased Single Player

Josh could make music potentially

field of vision fog of war
camera control zoom and move around map
avatar control - awsd 
interation pickup - use
hotbar? inventory system with volumetric limits

game loop is not continuous, its a turn base, so process on turns.
character stats?  stamina  and maybe hazard stat that represents oxygen or other things depending on hazard. 
visually we just have stamina on gui and show hazard bar when applied, some items override hazard (ie oxygen tank underwater...)

Future - Procedurally generated maze. for now we will make a static maze

determine ideas for items, traps, terrain

Single player to start (Multiplayer? maybe?)

Drew to revisit Unity for next 2 weeks
Keith working through Blender, make some basic block assets for Walls (Corner, Door, Opening, Straight), PC Avatar, Powerups
think of items, objects, traps etc..
